The [Official MyAnimeList API](http://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api) needs lots of work and is pretty annoying to use. Work and/or further development on it seems like a lost cause, since the developer(s) have far more pressing concerns with the site.

This API aims to provide an easy to use Python API that wraps around MAL's
REST-API.

Name inspired by [Horo/Holo](http://myanimelist.net/character/7373/Holo) from [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou?q=Spice%20and%20Wolf).

API inspired by other attempts (which made their own REST API wrapper, while this one uses a pure Python implementation), such as [crobert22](https://github.com/croberts22)'s [Railgun](https://github.com/croberts22/railgun) and [chuyeow](https://github.com/chuyeow)'s [myanimelist-api](https://github.com/chuyeow/myanimelist-api).
