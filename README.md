The Official MAL API needs lots of work and is pretty annoying to use.
Work and/or further development on it seems like a lost cause, since 
the developer(s) have far more pressing concerns with the site.

This API aims to provide an easy to use Python API that wraps around MAL's
HTTP request based API.
